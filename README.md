Sign in as player 1 or player 2 using the name input.

When both players are ready, player 1 will choose rock, paper, or scissors. Then, player 2 will choose rock, paper, or scissors. Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper. The first player to 5 wins!

For more fun, be sure to chat with your opponent using the chat box after signing in.
