DEPLOYED PROJECT LINK: https://rocksteadyrose.github.io/RPS-Multiplayer/

This application allows two users with separate devices to play Rock Paper Scissors against one another. Users' stats, choices, and chat messages are tracked and updated in realtime via Firebase.

Sign in as player 1 or player 2 using the name input.

When both players are ready, player 1 will choose rock, paper, or scissors. Then, player 2 will choose rock, paper, or scissors. Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper. The first player to 5 wins!

For more fun, be sure to chat with your opponent using the chat box after signing in.
